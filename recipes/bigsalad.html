    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <!-- 
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
black pepper to taste
4 cups spring greens
seeds, nuts, or any other crunchies for topping if you want (not necessary though!)
     -->
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups spring greens</li>
        <li>seeds, nuts, or any other crunchies for topping if you want (not necessary though!)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <!-- 
Shake dressing ingredients up in a jar. Taste and adjust to get it just right for how you like it.
Toss a generous amount of spring greens with just a few light drizzles of dressing â€“ you want to get the leaves entirely coated in dressing (but not so much that they get soggy). I often use my hands to gently toss it well without breaking all the greens. Serve immediately.
